        The planche and the front lever are two of the most iconic skills in
        calisthenics. If you’ve ever watched someone hold either position,
        you’ve probably asked the same question:

        Is the planche harder than the front lever?
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
        Short answer: for most people, yes.  
        <br />
        Long answer: it depends on biomechanics, background, and how your body
        is built.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-6">
        Why the Planche Is Usually Harder
      </h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">
        1. You’re Pushing Your Entire Bodyweight
      </h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Humans are generally stronger at pulling than pushing. The planche
        forces your shoulders, chest, and arms to support your full body
        against gravity.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">
        2. Extreme Shoulder Position
      </h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In a planche, your shoulders are far in front of your hands, creating
        massive leverage demands. Small changes in lean dramatically increase
        difficulty.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">
        3. Wrist Load
      </h3>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Unlike the front lever, the planche places high stress on the wrists —
        one reason many athletes struggle early on.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">
        Why Some People Find the Front Lever Easier
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The front lever benefits from:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-12">
        <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          Stronger natural pulling mechanics
        </li>
        <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          Less wrist stress
        </li>
        <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          More accessible progressions
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
        Many athletes achieve a solid front lever months — or even years —
        before their first clean planche hold.

        Muscle Demands Compared
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Both skills use the core heavily, but their upper-body emphasis differs.
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-12">
        <li className="text-base leading-relaxed">
          Planche → shoulders, chest, triceps, scapula

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
        Weak pushing strength often exposes itself brutally during planche
        training.

      {/* TIMELINE */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">
        Which One Takes Longer to Learn?
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        For most beginners:

          Planche: 1.5–3+ years
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        These timelines depend heavily on prerequisites, consistency, and

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">
        Final Verdict: Is the Planche Harder?
      </h2>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        For the majority of people, yes — the planche is harder than the front
        lever.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
        It demands more pushing strength, places higher stress on joints, and
        progresses slower.
      </p>

      <p className="text-base leading-relaxed mb-12">
        That said, body type, training history, and discipline matter. Some
        athletes with strong pressing backgrounds may progress faster in the
        planche than expected.
