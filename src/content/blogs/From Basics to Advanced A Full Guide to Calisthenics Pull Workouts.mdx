# From Basics to Advanced: A Full Guide to Calisthenics Pull Workouts

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced athlete, this guide will take you through the essential pull workouts to build a strong and well-rounded back.

## Starting with the Basics

Dead hangs are the foundation of any pull workout, improving grip strength and shoulder mobility.

### 2. **Assisted Pull-Ups**

Start with assisted pull-ups using bands or a partner to build foundational strength.

### 3. **Scapular Pull-Ups**

This exercise teaches shoulder control and stability, essential for progressing to more advanced moves.

## Intermediate Pull Exercises

### 1. **Standard Pull-Ups**

Once you've mastered the basics, move on to standard pull-ups. Focus on proper form and full range of motion.

### 2. **Chin-Ups**

Chin-ups are a great alternative to pull-ups, with more emphasis on the biceps.

### 3. **Negative Pull-Ups**

Negative pull-ups focus on the eccentric phase, helping build strength and control.
