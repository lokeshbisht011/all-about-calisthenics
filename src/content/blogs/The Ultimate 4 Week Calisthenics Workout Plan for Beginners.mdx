# The Ultimate 4-Week Calisthenics Workout Plan for Beginners

Calisthenics is an excellent way to build strength and endurance without needing fancy equipment. This 4-week workout plan is designed for beginners looking to develop full-body strength while improving flexibility and coordination.

Each week will focus on basic bodyweight movements, gradually increasing in intensity and volume. By the end of the plan, you'll have built a strong foundation to tackle more advanced exercises.

## Week 1: Establishing the Basics

In the first week, you'll focus on mastering foundational calisthenics exercises with proper form. Aim for 3 workout sessions spaced throughout the week.

**Exercises:**
- **Push-ups (3 sets of 8-10 reps)**  
  Targets chest, shoulders, and triceps. Focus on keeping a straight line from head to heels.
  
- **Squats (3 sets of 10-12 reps)**  
  Builds strength in quads, hamstrings, and glutes. Ensure your knees track over your toes.
  
- **Plank (3 sets of 30 seconds)**  
  Strengthens the core. Keep your body in a straight line, engaging your abs and glutes.

- **Lunges (3 sets of 8-10 reps per leg)**  
  Improves leg strength and balance. Step forward and lower your back knee to just above the floor.

- **Superman Hold (3 sets of 20 seconds)**  
  Works the lower back. Lie on your stomach and lift your arms and legs, holding the position.

*Tip:* Focus on controlling your movements and perfecting your form.

## Week 2: Building Endurance

Now that you've gotten comfortable with the basics, Week 2 increases the volume of work while adding a few new exercises.

**Exercises:**
- **Push-ups (4 sets of 10 reps)**  
  Increase your reps to build endurance in your upper body.
  
- **Squats (4 sets of 15 reps)**  
  Add more reps to your squats to push your lower body endurance.

- **Plank (4 sets of 40 seconds)**  
  Extend your hold time to continue developing core strength.

- **Mountain Climbers (3 sets of 20 seconds)**  
  Engage your core and work on your cardio with this fast-paced movement. Alternate bringing your knees to your chest in a plank position.

- **Reverse Lunges (3 sets of 10 reps per leg)**  
  Add variety to your lunges by stepping back, which targets the glutes.

*Tip:* Perform the exercises with slow and controlled movements to maximize muscle engagement.

## Week 3: Increasing Intensity

By Week 3, you should feel more confident in your form, so it's time to introduce some more intense exercises.

**Exercises:**
- **Push-ups (4 sets of 12-15 reps)**  
  Challenge your upper body with higher reps.

- **Pike Push-ups (3 sets of 8-10 reps)**  
  This advanced push-up variation works your shoulders. Keep your hips high and lower your head toward the floor.

- **Jump Squats (4 sets of 12 reps)**  
  Add a plyometric element to your squats by jumping explosively at the top.

- **Plank (4 sets of 50 seconds)**  
  Continue increasing your plank hold time to build core endurance.

- **Side Plank (3 sets of 20 seconds per side)**  
  Targets your obliques. Hold your body in a straight line with your elbow under your shoulder.

*Tip:* Push yourself, but keep your form consistent to avoid injury.

## Week 4: Peak Performance

The final week of the plan pushes you to your limits with a combination of strength and cardio.

**Exercises:**
- **Push-ups (4 sets of 15-20 reps)**  
  Push yourself to do as many reps as possible while maintaining proper form.

- **Burpees (3 sets of 10 reps)**  
  A full-body movement that adds cardio to your routine.

- **Squats (5 sets of 20 reps)**  
  By now, your lower body should be strong enough to handle high-volume squats.

- **Plank (4 sets of 60 seconds)**  
  You've worked up to a full minute. Hold steady and focus on keeping your core tight.

- **Plank to Push-up (3 sets of 10 reps)**  
  Transition from a plank to a push-up position, working your core and upper body at the same time.

*Tip:* At the end of the week, test yourself by doing a maximum rep set for push-ups and squats.
