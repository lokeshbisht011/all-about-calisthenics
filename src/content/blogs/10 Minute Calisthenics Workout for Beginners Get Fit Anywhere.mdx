### 1. Jumping Jacks

**Targets:** Full body, including legs, shoulders, and core

Jumping jacks are a great warm-up exercise that gets your heart rate up and engages your entire body.

**How to Perform:**
- Stand with your feet together and arms at your sides.
- Jump your feet out while raising your arms overhead.
- Jump back to the starting position and repeat.

*Tip:* Keep a steady rhythm, and focus on soft landings to reduce impact on your joints.

### 2. Bodyweight Squats

**Targets:** Quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core

Squats are a foundational movement in calisthenics that strengthen your lower body while improving balance and mobility.

**How to Perform:**
- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, toes pointing slightly outward.
- Lower your body by bending at the knees and hips, as if sitting back into a chair.
- Keep your chest up and weight on your heels.
- Push through your heels to return to the starting position.

*Tip:* Make sure your knees don’t extend past your toes during the movement.

### 3. Push-Ups

**Targets:** Chest, shoulders, triceps, and core

Push-ups are a fantastic upper-body exercise that also engages your core. They’re easy to modify, making them great for beginners.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
- Lower your body toward the floor by bending your elbows.
- Push yourself back up to the starting position.

*Tip:* If full push-ups are too challenging, you can perform them on your knees or against a wall.

### 4. Mountain Climbers

**Targets:** Core, shoulders, and legs

Mountain climbers are a dynamic movement that works your core while giving you a cardio boost. This exercise is great for building endurance and improving coordination.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders.
- Drive one knee toward your chest, then quickly switch legs, mimicking a running motion.
- Keep your core engaged and your back flat throughout the movement.

*Tip:* Maintain a controlled pace, especially if you're new to this exercise. Speed will come with practice.

### 5. Plank

**Targets:** Core, shoulders, and glutes

The plank is an isometric exercise that strengthens your entire core while also working your shoulders and glutes. It’s an excellent way to build endurance and stability.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a forearm plank position, with your elbows directly under your shoulders and your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Hold this position for the full 40 seconds, keeping your core tight and hips level.

*Tip:* Avoid letting your hips sag or raising them too high. Focus on maintaining a straight line.

## Why Calisthenics Is Perfect for Beginners

Calisthenics is ideal for beginners because it doesn’t require any special equipment or access to a gym. These bodyweight exercises can be done anywhere, making them highly convenient for people with busy schedules. Additionally, calisthenics helps improve flexibility, balance, and functional strength, which are important for overall health and fitness.

Here’s why calisthenics stands out for beginners:
1. **Low Impact:** Many calisthenics exercises are gentle on the joints, reducing the risk of injury.
2. **No Equipment Needed:** All you need is your body weight, making it accessible to everyone.
3. **Progressive:** As you build strength and confidence, you can increase the difficulty of each exercise through variations and progressions.
4. **Full-Body Workout:** Even simple movements engage multiple muscle groups, providing an effective workout for your entire body.

## How to Stay Consistent

While a 10-minute workout might seem short, consistency is key to seeing results. Try to incorporate this routine into your day at least 3-4 times per week. As you become more comfortable with the exercises, you can increase the number of circuits or add more challenging variations to continue progressing.
