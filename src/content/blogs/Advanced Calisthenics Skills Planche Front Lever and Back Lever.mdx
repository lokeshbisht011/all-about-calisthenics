# Advanced Calisthenics Skills: Planche, Front Lever, and Back Lever

For those looking to push their limits, advanced calisthenics skills like the planche, front lever, and back lever offer a serious challenge.

## Planche

The planche is an impressive skill that requires strength, balance, and control, where the body is held parallel to the ground, supported only by the hands.

- **How to Train:** Start with planche leans and tuck planches to build strength and balance.

## Front Lever

The front lever is a static hold where the body is held horizontal and parallel to the ground, supported by straight arms on a bar.

- **How to Train:** Begin with tuck lever holds and gradually extend your legs as you gain strength.

## Back Lever

The back lever involves hanging from a bar or rings and holding your body horizontal, facing downwards.

- **How to Train:** Start with tuck back lever holds and slowly work towards straightening your body.
