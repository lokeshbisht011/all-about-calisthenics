# Pull-Up Variations: Targeting Different Muscles with Calisthenics

Pull-ups are a versatile exercise that can be modified to target different muscle groups. This blog explores various pull-up variations and how they can enhance your calisthenics routine.

## Targeting the Lats

### 1. **Wide-Grip Pull-Ups**

Wide-grip pull-ups emphasize the lats, helping to build a wider and more powerful back.

### 2. **Commando Pull-Ups**

Commando pull-ups target both the lats and the obliques, providing a full upper body workout.

### 3. **Archer Pull-Ups**

Archer pull-ups isolate each side of the lats, increasing the challenge and improving muscle symmetry.

## Targeting the Biceps

### 1. **Chin-Ups**

Chin-ups place more emphasis on the biceps, making them an excellent complement to standard pull-ups.

### 2. **Close-Grip Pull-Ups**

Close-grip pull-ups target the biceps and the inner back muscles, helping to build arm strength and size.

### 3. **Mixed-Grip Pull-Ups**

Mixed-grip pull-ups combine the benefits of both chin-ups and pull-ups, engaging the biceps and the back.

## Targeting the Core

### 1. **Hanging Leg Raises**

Incorporate hanging leg raises into your pull-up routine to engage the core and build abdominal strength.

### 2. **L-Sit Pull-Ups**

L-sit pull-ups require core stabilization, making them a challenging variation that targets both the upper body and the core.

### 3. **Toes-to-Bar**

Toes-to-bar combines a pull-up with a core exercise, providing a full-body workout in one movement.
