# The Foundation of Strength: Push-Ups, Dips, and Pike Push-Ups

Upper body strength is a key component of calisthenics. Here are three fundamental exercises to get you started.

## Push-Ups

The classic push-up is a staple in any workout routine, targeting the chest, shoulders, and triceps.

- **How to Perform:** Start in a plank position with hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor, then push back up.

## Dips

Dips are excellent for building tricep, chest, and shoulder strength.

- **How to Perform:** Use parallel bars or the edge of a bench. Lower your body by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows, then push back up.

## Pike Push-Ups

A great exercise for targeting the shoulders and mimicking the movement of a handstand push-up.

- **How to Perform:** Start in a downward dog position with your hips raised. Lower your head towards the ground by bending your elbows, then push back up.
