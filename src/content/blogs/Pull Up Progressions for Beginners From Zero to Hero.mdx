# Pull-Up Progressions for Beginners: From Zero to Hero

Struggling to do your first pull-up? You're not alone. This guide provides a step-by-step progression to help beginners achieve their first pull-up and beyond.

## Building Basic Strength

### 1. **Dead Hangs**

Start with dead hangs to build grip strength and familiarize yourself with the pull-up bar.

### 2. **Scapular Pull-Ups**

Scapular pull-ups help activate the back muscles and improve shoulder stability, essential for pull-ups.

### 3. **Assisted Pull-Ups**

Use resistance bands or an assisted pull-up machine to build strength and confidence.

## Intermediate Progressions

### 1. **Negative Pull-Ups**

Focus on the eccentric phase by slowly lowering yourself from the top of the pull-up position.

### 2. **Inverted Rows**

Inverted rows are a great way to build the necessary pulling strength while keeping your feet on the ground.

### 3. **Lat Pulldowns**

Incorporate lat pulldowns into your routine to strengthen the muscles involved in pull-ups.

## Achieving Your First Pull-Up

### 1. **Controlled Reps**

Work on performing one or two controlled pull-ups with perfect form, focusing on quality over quantity.

### 2. **Progressive Reps**

Gradually increase the number of reps as your strength improves, aiming for 3-5 reps per set.

### 3. **Consistency is Key**

Stay consistent with your training, and you'll soon be able to perform multiple pull-ups with ease.
