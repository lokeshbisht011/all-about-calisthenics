# From Push-Ups to Handstands: A Step-by-Step Guide to Calisthenics Progressions

Calisthenics is a dynamic form of exercise that utilizes bodyweight movements to build strength, flexibility, and control. One of the most appealing aspects of calisthenics is its scalability—whether you're a beginner or an advanced practitioner, you can continually challenge yourself with progressions. In this guide, we'll take you through a step-by-step journey from fundamental exercises like push-ups to advanced skills such as handstands, showing you how to progress safely and effectively.

## Understanding Progressions in Calisthenics

Progressions in calisthenics involve gradually increasing the difficulty of exercises to build strength, skill, and control. This approach allows your body to adapt to new challenges and achieve more advanced movements over time. Here's a breakdown of how to progress from basic to advanced calisthenics skills.

## 1. **Push-Ups: Building the Foundation**

### **Step 1: Wall Push-Ups**
- **Objective:** Develop initial upper body strength and technique.
- **How to Do It:** Stand facing a wall, place your hands on the wall at shoulder height, and lean in towards the wall while keeping your body straight. Push yourself back to the starting position.

### **Step 2: Incline Push-Ups**
- **Objective:** Increase strength and prepare for floor push-ups.
- **How to Do It:** Perform push-ups with your hands on an elevated surface like a bench or step. This reduces the load on your upper body compared to floor push-ups.

### **Step 3: Standard Push-Ups**
- **Objective:** Master the basic push-up form and build strength.
- **How to Do It:** Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the floor, keep your body in a straight line, and lower yourself until your chest nearly touches the ground. Push back up to the starting position.

### **Step 4: Decline Push-Ups**
- **Objective:** Increase difficulty and target the upper chest and shoulders.
- **How to Do It:** Place your feet on an elevated surface while your hands remain on the floor. Perform push-ups as usual.

### **Step 5: Archer Push-Ups**
- **Objective:** Enhance unilateral strength and control.
- **How to Do It:** Spread your hands wider than shoulder-width and lower yourself towards one hand while keeping the other arm extended. Alternate sides.

## 2. **Pull-Ups: Building Upper Body Strength**

### **Step 1: Assisted Pull-Ups**
- **Objective:** Build foundational strength for pull-ups.
- **How to Do It:** Use a resistance band or an assisted pull-up machine to help lift your body.

### **Step 2: Negative Pull-Ups**
- **Objective:** Develop strength for the upward phase of a pull-up.
- **How to Do It:** Jump or use a step to get your chin above the bar, then lower yourself slowly and with control.

### **Step 3: Standard Pull-Ups**
- **Objective:** Master the basic pull-up movement.
- **How to Do It:** Hang from a bar with an overhand grip, pull your body up until your chin is above the bar, and lower yourself back down.

### **Step 4: Chest-to-Bar Pull-Ups**
- **Objective:** Increase difficulty and target the back muscles more intensely.
- **How to Do It:** Pull yourself up until your chest touches the bar, then lower yourself slowly.

### **Step 5: L-Sit Pull-Ups**
- **Objective:** Combine core and upper body strength.
- **How to Do It:** Perform pull-ups while holding your legs extended in front of you, forming an “L” shape with your body.

## 3. **Dips: Developing Triceps and Chest Strength**

### **Step 1: Bench Dips**
- **Objective:** Build initial triceps strength.
- **How to Do It:** Sit on a bench with your hands next to your hips, extend your legs out, and lower your body by bending your elbows, then push back up.

### **Step 2: Assisted Dips**
- **Objective:** Prepare for unassisted dips.
- **How to Do It:** Use an assisted dip machine or resistance bands to help lift your body during the dip.

### **Step 3: Standard Dips**
- **Objective:** Master the basic dip technique.
- **How to Do It:** Use parallel bars or dip bars, lower your body by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows, and push back up.

### **Step 4: Weighted Dips**
- **Objective:** Increase difficulty and strength.
- **How to Do It:** Perform dips while wearing a weight belt or holding a dumbbell between your legs.

## 4. **Handstands: Mastering Balance and Strength**

### **Step 1: Wall Handstands**

- **How to Do It:** Kick up into a handstand against a wall, holding the position and gradually decreasing the reliance on the wall.

### **Step 2: Wall Walks**
- **Objective:** Improve shoulder strength and handstand position.
- **How to Do It:** Start in a push-up position with your feet against the wall. Walk your feet up the wall and your hands closer to the wall until you’re in a handstand position.

### **Step 3: Freestanding Handstands**
- **Objective:** Master the skill of balancing without wall support.
- **How to Do It:** Kick up into a handstand from a standing position and practice balancing in the center of the room.

### **Step 4: Handstand Push-Ups**
