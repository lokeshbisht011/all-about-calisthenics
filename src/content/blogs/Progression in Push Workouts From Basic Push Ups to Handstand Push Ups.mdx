# Progression in Push Workouts: From Basic Push-Ups to Handstand Push-Ups

Push workouts are a fundamental part of any calisthenics routine, and progression is key to making continuous gains. Whether you're just starting out or looking to master advanced push exercises like handstand push-ups, this guide will help you understand how to progress effectively and safely.

## Understanding Push Workout Progression

Progression in push workouts involves gradually increasing the difficulty of the exercises to build strength, endurance, and control. This can be achieved by:

- **Increasing Resistance:** Moving from easier to harder variations of the same exercise.
- **Adding Volume:** Increasing the number of sets and repetitions.
- **Improving Form:** Perfecting your technique to maximize muscle engagement and reduce the risk of injury.

## The Basics: Push-Up Mastery

Before moving on to more advanced exercises, it's important to master the basic push-up. Here's how to ensure you're performing push-ups correctly:

1. **Hand Placement:** Place your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart, with fingers pointing forward.
2. **Body Alignment:** Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels, engaging your core.
3. **Lowering and Pushing:** Lower your body until your chest is just above the ground, then push back up with control.

Once you can perform 3 sets of 12-15 push-ups with perfect form, you're ready to progress.

## Intermediate Progression: Advanced Push-Up Variations

After mastering the basic push-up, you can start incorporating more challenging variations into your routine:

### 1. **Diamond Push-Ups**

Diamond push-ups place more emphasis on the triceps. Bring your hands together under your chest, forming a diamond shape with your thumbs and index fingers.

### 2. **Archer Push-Ups**

Archer push-ups involve shifting your weight to one side, extending the opposite arm out to the side. This variation increases the load on the working arm, making it a great progression exercise.

### 3. **Plyometric Push-Ups**

Plyometric push-ups are an explosive variation that helps build power. Push off the ground with enough force to lift your hands off the ground, and clap them together before landing.

### 4. **Pseudo Planche Push-Ups**

Pseudo planche push-ups mimic the planche position by shifting your hands back towards your hips and leaning forward. This variation increases the demand on your shoulders and core.

## Advanced Progression: Handstand Push-Ups

Handstand push-ups are the pinnacle of push workout progression, requiring significant strength, balance, and control. Here's how to work your way up to this advanced exercise:

### 1. **Pike Push-Ups**

Pike push-ups are an excellent preparatory exercise for handstand push-ups. Start in a downward dog position, then lower your head towards the ground, keeping your hips high.

### 2. **Wall-Assisted Handstand Push-Ups**

Performing handstand push-ups against a wall provides the necessary support to build strength and confidence. Start with partial reps and gradually increase the range of motion.

### 3. **Freestanding Handstand Push-Ups**

Once you've mastered wall-assisted handstand push-ups, try performing them without the wall. Start with negatives (lowering phase only) to build control, and gradually progress to full repetitions.

## Sample Progression Plan

Here's a sample plan to help you progress from basic push-ups to handstand push-ups:

### **Week 1-2:**
- Focus on mastering basic push-ups with perfect form.
- Perform 3 sets of 12-15 reps, resting 60 seconds between sets.

### **Week 3-4:**
- Introduce diamond push-ups and archer push-ups.
- Perform 3 sets of 8-10 reps for each variation, with 90 seconds of rest between sets.

### **Week 5-6:**
- Start incorporating plyometric push-ups and pseudo planche push-ups.
- Perform 3 sets of 6-8 reps for each variation, with 2 minutes of rest between sets.

### **Week 7-8:**
- Begin practicing pike push-ups and wall-assisted handstand push-ups.
- Perform 3 sets of 5-7 reps for each exercise, with 2-3 minutes of rest between sets.

### **Beyond Week 8:**
- Progress to freestanding handstand push-ups.
- Start with negatives and work towards full repetitions, performing 3-4 sets with 3-4 minutes of rest between sets.
