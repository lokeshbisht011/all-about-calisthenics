# Getting Started with Grip Variations: Neutral Grip, Pronated Grip, and Supinated Grip

Understanding grip variations is crucial for mastering different calisthenics exercises. Let's break down the basics.

## Neutral Grip

The neutral grip is when your palms face each other. Itâ€™s commonly used in exercises like pull-ups and rows.

- **Benefits:** Easier on the wrists and shoulders, and it targets the biceps and upper back more effectively.

## Pronated Grip

Also known as an overhand grip, the pronated grip is when your palms face away from you.

- **Benefits:** Commonly used in pull-ups and chin-ups, this grip focuses on the upper back and lats.

## Supinated Grip

Also known as an underhand grip, the supinated grip is when your palms face toward you.

- **Benefits:** This grip emphasizes the biceps and is commonly used in chin-ups.
