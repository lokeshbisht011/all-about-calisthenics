# Building Lower Body Strength: Pistol Squats, Shrimp Squats, and Bulgarian Split Squats

Lower body strength is just as important in calisthenics as upper body strength. These exercises will help you develop powerful legs without the need for weights.

## Pistol Squats

The pistol squat is a one-legged squat that requires strength, balance, and flexibility.

- **How to Perform:** Stand on one leg, extend the other leg forward, lower yourself down into a squat while keeping your extended leg off the ground, and then push back up.

## Shrimp Squats

Shrimp squats are another single-leg squat variation that targets the quads and glutes.

- **How to Perform:** Stand on one leg, grab the ankle of the other leg behind you, lower yourself down while keeping the knee of the bent leg close to the ground, and then push back up.

## Bulgarian Split Squats

Bulgarian split squats are a lunge variation that places more emphasis on the quads and glutes.

- **How to Perform:** Place one foot on a bench behind you, lower yourself into a lunge on the standing leg, and then push back up.

These lower body exercises will not only build strength but also improve balance and flexibility, which are crucial for overall calisthenics performance.
