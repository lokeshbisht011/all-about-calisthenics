# Core Strength Essentials: Hollow Body Hold, L-Sit, and Dragon Flag

A strong core is vital in calisthenics, supporting almost every movement. Here are three core exercises that are essential for any routine.

## Hollow Body Hold

The hollow body hold is a foundational exercise that strengthens the entire core, crucial for many advanced calisthenics moves.

- **How to Perform:** Lie on your back, lift your arms and legs slightly off the ground, and press your lower back into the floor. Hold this position while keeping your core engaged.

## L-Sit

An L-sit is an isometric exercise where you hold your body in an L-shape using parallel bars, rings, or the floor.

- **How to Perform:** Sit with your legs extended, place your hands by your hips, lift your body off the ground, and hold.

## Dragon Flag

The dragon flag, popularized by Bruce Lee, is a powerful core exercise that works the entire torso.

- **How to Perform:** Lie on a bench, grab the edge behind your head, lift your legs and torso into the air, and lower them down slowly without touching the ground.
