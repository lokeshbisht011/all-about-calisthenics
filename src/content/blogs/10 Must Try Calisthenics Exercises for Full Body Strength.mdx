# 10 Must-Try Calisthenics Exercises for Full-Body Strength

Calisthenics is a powerful and versatile way to build strength using nothing but your body weight. Whether you're new to fitness or an experienced athlete, calisthenics offers exercises that challenge every muscle group. Here are ten essential calisthenics exercises that you should incorporate into your routine for full-body strength.

## 1. Push-Ups

**Targets:** Chest, shoulders, triceps, and core.

Push-ups are a fundamental calisthenics exercise that strengthens your upper body and core. They can be easily modified to increase or decrease difficulty, making them accessible for all fitness levels.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a plank position with your hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
- Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor.
- Push yourself back up to the starting position.

*Tip:* Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels throughout the movement.

## 2. Pull-Ups

**Targets:** Back, biceps, and forearms.

Pull-ups are a classic upper-body exercise that builds significant strength in the back and arms. They also engage your core and improve grip strength.

**How to Perform:**
- Hang from a pull-up bar with your palms facing away from you.
- Pull your body up until your chin is above the bar.
- Lower yourself back down with control.

*Tip:* Start with assisted pull-ups or negatives if you’re unable to perform a full pull-up.

## 3. Dips

**Targets:** Triceps, chest, and shoulders.

Dips are an excellent exercise for targeting the triceps, along with the chest and shoulders. You can perform them on parallel bars or even on the edge of a sturdy surface like a bench.

**How to Perform:**
- Grip the bars or edge of the surface, with your hands shoulder-width apart.
- Lower your body by bending your elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor.
- Push yourself back up to the starting position.

*Tip:* Keep your elbows close to your body to emphasize the triceps.

## 4. Squats

**Targets:** Quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core.

Squats are a foundational lower-body exercise that builds strength in the legs and core. They also improve mobility and stability in the hips and ankles.

**How to Perform:**
- Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart.
- Lower your body by bending your knees and hips as if you're sitting back into a chair.
- Keep your chest up and your weight on your heels.
- Return to the starting position by pushing through your heels.

*Tip:* Go as deep as your mobility allows without compromising form.

## 5. Planks

**Targets:** Core, shoulders, and glutes.

Planks are a highly effective isometric exercise that strengthens the entire core, including the abs, obliques, and lower back. They also engage the shoulders and glutes.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a forearm plank position, with your elbows directly under your shoulders.
- Keep your body in a straight line from head to heels.
- Hold the position for as long as you can with good form.

*Tip:* Avoid letting your hips sag or pike up.

## 6. Lunges

**Targets:** Quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core.

Lunges are a great exercise for building lower-body strength and improving balance. They work each leg individually, helping to address muscle imbalances.

**How to Perform:**
- Step forward with one leg and lower your body until your front thigh is parallel to the floor.
- Keep your back leg bent with the knee hovering just above the floor.
- Push through your front heel to return to the starting position.

*Tip:* Keep your torso upright and avoid letting your front knee extend past your toes.

## 7. Burpees

**Targets:** Full body, including chest, shoulders, legs, and core.

Burpees are a high-intensity, full-body exercise that builds strength and cardiovascular endurance. They combine a squat, push-up, and jump into one movement.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a standing position.
- Drop into a squat and place your hands on the floor.
- Jump your feet back into a plank position and perform a push-up.
- Jump your feet back to your hands and explode into a jump.

*Tip:* Keep a steady pace to maintain form and prevent fatigue.

## 8. Hollow Body Hold

**Targets:** Core, especially the lower abs.

The hollow body hold is an isometric core exercise that challenges the abs and improves overall body control. It’s a common exercise in gymnastics and calisthenics routines.

**How to Perform:**
- Lie on your back with your arms extended overhead.
- Lift your shoulders and legs off the floor, creating a hollow "banana" shape with your body.
- Hold the position, keeping your lower back pressed into the floor.

*Tip:* If this is too challenging, try bending your knees or keeping your arms by your sides.

## 9. Inverted Rows

**Targets:** Back, biceps, and core.

Inverted rows are a beginner-friendly pulling exercise that targets the back and arms. They’re a great alternative to pull-ups if you’re building strength.

**How to Perform:**
- Lie under a bar or sturdy surface and grip it with your hands shoulder-width apart.
- Pull your chest up to the bar, keeping your body in a straight line.
- Lower yourself back down with control.

*Tip:* Adjust the difficulty by changing the angle of your body.

## 10. Pike Push-Ups

**Targets:** Shoulders, triceps, and upper chest.

Pike push-ups are a bodyweight exercise that mimics the overhead press. They’re an excellent way to build shoulder strength without weights.

**How to Perform:**
- Start in a downward-facing dog position with your hips lifted and arms extended.
- Lower your head toward the floor by bending your elbows.
- Push back up to the starting position.

*Tip:* The closer your feet are to your hands, the more challenging the exercise.
