# Archer Push-Up Mastery: A Challenge for Unilateral Strength

The archer push-up is a challenging variation that targets your chest, shoulders, triceps, and core while also improving unilateral strength and stability.

## How to Perform the Archer Push-Up

1. **Start in a Push-Up Position:** Begin in a standard push-up position with your hands wider than shoulder-width apart.
2. **Lower to One Side:** Lower your body toward one hand while extending the opposite arm out to the side, keeping it straight.
3. **Push Back Up:** Push through the bent arm to return to the starting position.
4. **Alternate Sides:** Repeat the movement on the other side, alternating between sides with each repetition.

## Tips for Success

- **Start with Modified Versions:** If the full archer push-up is too challenging, start with knee-assisted or incline variations.
- **Focus on Control:** Move slowly and with control to maximize muscle engagement and stability.
- **Aim for Balanced Reps:** Try to perform an equal number of reps on each side to avoid imbalances.

## Challenge Progression

- **Beginner:** Aim for 5 reps per side.
- **Intermediate:** Work up to 10 reps per side.
- **Advanced:** Perform 15 or more reps per side with perfect form.
