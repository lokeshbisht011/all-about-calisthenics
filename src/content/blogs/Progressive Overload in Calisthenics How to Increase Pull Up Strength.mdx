# Progressive Overload in Calisthenics: How to Increase Pull-Up Strength

Progressive overload is a fundamental principle for building strength. This blog explains how to apply it to your pull-up training to increase your strength and achieve your fitness goals.

## Understanding Progressive Overload

### 1. **Increasing Reps**

Start by gradually increasing the number of reps in each set to build endurance and strength.

### 2. **Adding Weight**

Once you've maxed out on reps, add weight to your pull-ups using a weighted vest or belt to continue progressing.

### 3. **Improving Technique**

Focus on perfecting your form and technique, which can help you engage more muscle fibers and improve strength.

## Advanced Overload Techniques

### 1. **Isometric Holds**

Incorporate isometric holds at the top of the pull-up to build strength and control.

### 2. **Slow Negatives**

Perform slow negatives, focusing on the eccentric phase of the pull-up to increase time under tension.

### 3. **Explosive Pull-Ups**

Explosive pull-ups help develop power and speed, taking your pull-up strength to the next level.

  - Dead hangs: 2 sets of 30 seconds
