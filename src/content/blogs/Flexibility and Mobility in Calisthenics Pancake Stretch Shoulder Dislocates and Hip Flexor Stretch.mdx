# Flexibility and Mobility in Calisthenics: Pancake Stretch, Shoulder Dislocates, and Hip Flexor Stretch

Flexibility and mobility are often overlooked in calisthenics, but they are essential for improving your performance and preventing injuries.

## Pancake Stretch

The pancake stretch improves flexibility in the hamstrings, hips, and lower back, which is essential for advanced calisthenics moves.

- **How to Perform:** Sit on the floor with your legs spread wide, lean forward while keeping your back straight, and reach towards the ground.

## Shoulder Dislocates

Shoulder dislocates are a mobility exercise that helps increase shoulder flexibility and prevent injuries.

- **How to Perform:** Hold a resistance band or stick with a wide grip, raise it overhead, and bring it behind your back while keeping your arms straight.

## Hip Flexor Stretch

The hip flexor stretch targets the muscles at the front of your hips, which are often tight due to prolonged sitting.

- **How to Perform:** Kneel on one knee, push your hips forward while keeping your back straight, and hold the stretch.
