# Bodyweight Leg Exercises: Squats, Lunges, and Step-Ups

Bodyweight leg exercises are fundamental in calisthenics, helping to build strength, endurance, and stability.

## Squats

The squat is a basic yet powerful exercise that targets the quads, hamstrings, and glutes.

- **How to Perform:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, lower your hips back and down as if sitting in a chair, and then push back up to standing.

## Lunges

Lunges are a dynamic exercise that works the quads, glutes, and hamstrings, while also improving balance.

- **How to Perform:** Step forward with one leg, lower your hips until both knees are bent at a 90-degree angle, and then push back to the starting position.

## Step-Ups

Step-ups are a functional exercise that targets the quads, glutes, and calves.

- **How to Perform:** Step onto a bench or sturdy platform with one leg, push through the heel to lift your body up, and then step back down with control.
